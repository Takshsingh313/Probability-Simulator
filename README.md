# Probability-Simulator
This is a probability simulator that lets you select an experiment and a number of trials. After running the simulation, It displays the frequency of each outcome (e.g., die face) using a bar graph and tracks the probability over time with a line graph.
## Features

### Coin Flip Probability Simulation
- Simulates Heads/Tails outcomes and shows how frequencies approach 50/50 as trial count increases
### Single Dice Roll Probability
- Simulates a fair six-sided die and shows the probability distribution for faces 1–6, approaching 1/6 each.
### Two-Dice Sum Probability
- Simulates rolling two dice and computes the probability of sums 2–12, naturally showing higher probability for 7 and lower for 2 & 12.
### Running Probability Over Time
- A line graph tracks how probability stabilizes as trial count increases (Law of Large Numbers).
### Outcome Frequency Distribution
- Bar charts show how often each coin outcome, dice face, or dice sum occurred, helping users understand randomness and variation.
